			The flesh and juice of the pineapple are used in cuisines around the world. In many tropical countries, pineapple is prepared, and sold on roadsides as a snack. Our pineapples have their leaves combed and trimmed, and their skins polished with coconut water every day, to ensure their utmost beauty.

			Mangoes are generally sweet, although the taste and texture of the flesh varies across cultivars, some having a soft, pulpy texture similar to an overripe plum. Our mangoes are grown in pure, unfiltered sunlight and spritzed with pineapple juice everyday to ensure maximum plumpness.
